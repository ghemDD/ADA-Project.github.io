  <p>Is Hollywood’s social network composition unique or do other movie industries follow suit ? Hollywood is the most famous movie production industry in the world. It has a reputation of being a high-class, exclusive and hard to get in environment. Having a good network is undoubtedly very important to make it there. Clubs, communities and social dynamics between actors, directors, and producers take shape within this environment</p>
  
  <p>What are the specifities of the composition and shape of the Hollywood social network ? Are they unique and part of its “identity” or is it a social network that all movie industries follow / or are bound to (Bollywood, Chinawood being other major movie industries). Through a “co-stardom graph” showing actors who played in the same movies, we will look at its evolution over time and compute different graph metrics (centrality,…), run cluster analysis and compare these metrics across different industries.</p>

    Here we include some of our initial analyses.

  <p> We begin our analysis with a part of the actors that exhibits pre dominant character tropes features : as we will see 
    most of them are Hollywood actors featuring in successful movies (in average). Can you guess the top genres containing 
    the most character tropes ?

    As you could have guessed, the Action genre contains the most clichés characters such as ... . We might wonder next what are the most
    frequent character types ?

    We next want to know who are the most successful actors : for this purpose, we compute the global movie revenue 
    of the films in which an actor/actress starred in (i.e the sum of the individual revenue). We next plot the ten most successful 
    actors that have a character trope :

  <p>
    Once we had the co-stardom graphs for Hollywood and Bollywood, we compared them using different centrality measures and network analysis techniques. 
  For example, we found that the average degree, or the average number of connections per actor, was higher in Hollywood than in Bollywood. 
  This means that actors in Hollywood tend to work with more people. We also found that the clustering coefficient, or the measure of how much actors cluster together in groups, was higher in Bollywood. 
  This shows that actors in Bollywood are more likely to work with the same colleagues over and over.
