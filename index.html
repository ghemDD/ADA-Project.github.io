  <p>Is Hollywood’s social network composition unique or do other movie industries follow suit ? Hollywood is the most famous movie production industry in the world. It has a reputation of being a high-class, exclusive and hard to get in environment. Having a good network is undoubtedly very important to make it there. Clubs, communities and social dynamics between actors, directors, and producers take shape within this environment</p>
  
  <p>What are the specifities of the composition and shape of the Hollywood social network ? Are they unique and part of its “identity” or is it a social network that all movie industries follow / or are bound to (Bollywood, Chinawood being other major movie industries). Through a “co-stardom graph” showing actors who played in the same movies, we will look at its evolution over time and compute different graph metrics (centrality,…), run cluster analysis and compare these metrics across different industries.</p>

  <h2 id="OfCharactersAndMen">Of Characters and Men</h2>
  
  <p> We begin our analysis with a part of the actors that exhibits pre dominant character tropes features : as we will see 
    most of them are Hollywood actors featuring in successful movies (in average). Can you guess the top movie genres containing 
    the most character tropes ?

    <p><img src="images/top_genres.png" alt="image", width="100%", height="400px" /></p>

    As you could have guessed, the Action genre contains the most clichés characters such as ... . We might wonder next what are the most
    frequent character types ?

    <p><img src="images/character_type_hist.png" alt="image", width="90%", height="400px", left-margin="10px" /></p>

    We next want to know who are the most successful actors : for this purpose, we compute the global movie revenue 
    of the films in which an actor/actress starred in (i.e the sum of the individual revenue). We next plot the ten most successful 
    actors that have a character trope : 

    Next, we want to plot the Actor on a lower dimensional plan, using Principal Components Analysis :
    <p><img src="images/pca_actors.png" alt="image", width="80%", height="80%", left-margin="10px" /></p>

    We can see an interesting plot when only selecting the top 10 actors : 
    <p><img src="images/pca_top_10.png" alt="image", width="80%", height="80%", left-margin="10px" /></p>
 
    Next we compute the graph of the top 10 successful (global movie revenue) actors, and their direct co-cast relationship in an interactive graph in which you can select the node (actor name) you want to highlight (Tip: Zoom in to see the actor names).

  <h3 id="Community detection"> Community Detection</h3>

  <p> Upon examining the co-stardom graphs of Hollywood and Bollywood, it is evident that there are significant differences in the structures of the networks. *
    The Hollywood graph displays multiple distinct communities, while the Bollywood graph is centered around a single central community with several smaller communities in close proximity.</p>

    <p><img src="images/hollywood_network.png" alt="image", width="80%"/></p>

    <p>One possible explanation for this difference is that the Hollywood film industry may be more collaborative, with actors frequently working together on multiple projects and forming strong connections as a result. 
      The presence of multiple distinct communities in the Hollywood network suggests that there are different groups of actors who frequently work together and may be more closely tied to one another than actors in other communities.</p>

    <p><img src="images/bollywood_network.png" alt="image", width="80%"/></p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, the centralized structure of the Bollywood network may indicate a hierarchical system in which a select group of actors hold more power and influence within the industry. 
      The smaller communities surrounding the central community may represent actors who are connected to this group in some way, either through shared projects or personal relationships.
    </p>

    <p><img src="images/hollywood_cd.png" alt="image", width="80%"/></p>

    <p>
      It is also worth noting that there are many nodes in the Bollywood network that are excluded from any particular community. 
      This may suggest that there are actors in Bollywood who are less connected to other actors in the industry, or who are not as closely tied to any particular group or community.

    Once we had the co-stardom graphs for Hollywood and Bollywood, we compared them using different centrality measures and network analysis techniques. 
  For example, we found that the average degree, or the average number of connections per actor, was higher in Hollywood than in Bollywood. 
  This means that actors in Hollywood tend to work with more people. We also found that the clustering coefficient, or the measure of how much actors cluster together in groups, was higher in Bollywood. 
  This shows that actors in Bollywood are more likely to work with the same colleagues over and over.

</p>
  

  <p> The
    average geodesic distance, being the mean of the shortest path lengths 
   among all connected pairs in the ego network, informs us of the degree 
   to which the nodes in the graph are connected to each other and how easy
    it is to reach one node from another. India having the lowest average 
   goedesic distance (india : 1.399, versus 
   usa:1.908, uk:1.743, fr:1.621), 
   we deduce that it is the country where actors are the most connected and
    where it is easy to reach one actor from another. It indicate that the 
   successfull actors are more connected and have a stronger sense of 
   community. Whereas it is less the case for the three other countries.</p>

<p>
  The
  average diameter, being the average length of the longest path between 
 connected actors for the four countries is not considerably different 
 (fr : 1.9, uk:2, usa:2, india:2), hence we can conclude from this regard
  any specific information on the difference in the connection of actor 
 in the graphs.
 
 Here
  the value of the average brokerage can inform us the overall influence 
 of nodes in a network, a high average brokerage informs that in the 
 industry of the given country, on average there are more very 
 influencial actors, that connect diffenrent group/communities together. 
 Which makes them very important actors to know (try at least). We see 
 from our results that the average value of the brokerage in the USA, UK 
 and France in high (7404, 20310, 4042, respectively), whereas this value
  is much (much) lower in India (235).
</p>

<p>
  Finally,
  we analyze the clustering coefficient. A higher clustering coefficient 
 indicates that the node's neighbors are more connected to each other and
  that there are more triangles in the neighborhood of the node. France 
 is the country with the highest clustering coefficient 
 (0.939, vs usa:0.621, uk:0.725, 
 India:0.733), and we can clearly see on its ego network 
 graphs that the structures are overall more triabgular. 
 Lower clustering coefficient indicates that the node's neighbors are 
 less connected to each other and that there are fewer triangles in the 
 neighborhood of the node. We can also clearly see that on the other's 
 countries' ego graphs.
</p>
  
  <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, these co-stardom networks provide a unique glimpse into the structures and dynamics of the Hollywood and Bollywood film industries. It's always fascinating to see how different industries operate and these networks give us a new way of looking at things. Who knows what other insights we'll uncover as we continue to analyze these networks in the future?
